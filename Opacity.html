      Opacity is the degree to which content behind an element is hidden, and is
      the opposity of transparency. Opacity applies to the element as a whole,
      including its contents, even though the value is not inhereted by child
      elements. Thus, the element and its chldren all have the same opacity
      relative to the element's background, even if they have different
      opacities relative to one another. If you do not want to apply opacity to
      child elements, us the background property instead.
